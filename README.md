## What does it do?

The Mod Loader for Distant Worlds 2 lets you load Asset Mods, Game Data mods and [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/) based C# code mods, 
without overwriting any of the game files.

Game data mods are supported by describing patches in YAML (.yml) format and assets can be converted to and from the game's format using the [Bundle Manager][6].

The Mod Loader will take care of combining patches from multiple mods and resolving mod load order.

It also comes with minor Quality of Life improvements and bug fixes for the game.
